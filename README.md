## student workflow

* this repo provides a framework for the student workflow of the bootcamp.
students are expected to:
    * fork the repo on github.
    * clone the fork on their local machine.
    * optional: add the bin/ directory to their PATH.
    * create a new subdir under acts/ for each activity.
    * create tests for each script.
    * add the subdir, commit, and push it to github.
    * set up their jenkins instance to run tests on checkin.

* shell script tests are to be done with shunit2 and/or shiot.
* python tests are to be created using the unittest module,
and run with nosetests.
* ruby tests are to be created using rspec.
